Developed an analytics solution to monitor and analyze IndiHome add-on sales, including services such as Speed on Demand, Upgrade Speed, and Upload Booster. The project focused on identifying fraudulent customer behavior by analyzing detailed transaction histories for add-ons with monthly purchase limits, such as Speed on Demand and Speed Refreshment.

Through interactive dashboards built for each add-on, the system reveals sales trends and transaction statuses across multiple time granularities (daily to monthly), highlights customers engaging in potentially fraudulent activity, and generates demographic insights to support more targeted marketing strategies. The analysis also evaluates the impact of pricing changes on Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and add-on sales performance.
