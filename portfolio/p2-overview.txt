Developed an AI-powered service to enhance the electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC) process by automatically extracting customer information from official documents, including KTP (Indonesian Identity Card), SIM (Indonesian Driving License), Passport, NPWP (Indonesian Tax ID), and SK Pensiun (Retirement Certificate).

The system performs intelligent typo correction for location-related fields—ranging from province names down to sub-districts—ensuring data consistency and reliability. The service is served using FastAPI, then packaged as a Docker image and deployed on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for scalability and production readiness.
