Developed a network traffic forecasting system to support data-driven Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) optimization in the telecommunications domain. The system estimates future traffic demand to guide resource allocation—such as bandwidth provisioning—across specific network locations, particularly during peak seasons or temporary events. These forecasts enable more accurate capacity planning and help reshape infrastructure expansion strategies so that existing resources are utilized more efficiently.
