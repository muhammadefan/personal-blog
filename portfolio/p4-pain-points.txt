1. Deploying systems in uncertain and dynamic environments such as delivery fleets requires anticipating potential failures beyond software availability. Limited internet connectivity, fluctuating temperature and humidity affecting device performance, and practical installation constraints (such as the absence of a suitable placement location) highlighted the importance of considering operational realities early in the design phase.
