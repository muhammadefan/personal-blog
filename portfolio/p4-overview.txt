A monitoring system designed to track mango maturity levels from the time of harvest until delivery to the destination. During transportation via fleet, environmental factors such as room temperature and humidity are continuously monitored using an Internet of Things (IoT) device. These variables are processed and visualized through a web-based dashboard to estimate the mango’s current maturity level. The system enables receivers to make informed decisions on post-delivery handling, such as immediate distribution, storage, or further ripening.
