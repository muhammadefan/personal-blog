create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
activate virtual environment: 
- `source venv/Scripts/activate` (executed in bash terminal for Windows)
- `source venv/bin/activate` (executed in Mac terminal)
Once activated, your shell prompt will change to include the name of the environment in parentheses (e.g., (venv) ...$), indicating the virtual environment is active. 

install packages: While the environment is active, use pip install <package_name> to install libraries directly into this isolated environment.

deactivate virtual environment: To exit the virtual environment and return to your system's global Python, simply run the command: `deactivate`


create env with specified Python version (must be installed first) -> `py -3.10 -m venv venv_name`
